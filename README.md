# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

**dataset:** IMDB_top_1000 dataset, I have imported it from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows).
**Set-up:** pip install -r requirements.txt
**To run:** python3 simple_recommendation_sys.py

**Results:** 

_Input_: A masked vigilante fights against crime.

_output_: The output is a DataFrame with series_title and description.

## Overview

Build a **content-based recommendation system** that, given a **short text description** of a user’s preferences, suggests **similar items** (e.g., movies) from a small dataset. This challenge should take about **3 hours**, so keep your solution **simple** yet **functional**.

### Example Use Case

- The user inputs:  
  *"I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist."*  
- Your system processes this description (query) and compares it to a dataset of items (e.g., movies with their plot summaries or keywords).  
- You then return the **top 3–5 “closest” matches** to the user.

---

## Requirements

1. **Dataset**  
   - Use a **small** public dataset of items (e.g., a list of movies with plot summaries, or other textual descriptions).  
   - Make sure the dataset is easy to handle (maybe 100–500 rows) so the solution remains quick to implement and run.  
   - Include the dataset in your forked repository *or* provide instructions/link on how to download it.  

2. **Approach**  
   - **Content-Based**: At a minimum, use text similarity to recommend items.  
     - For instance, you can transform both the user’s text input and each item’s description into TF-IDF vectors and compute **cosine similarity**.  
   - Return the **top N** similar items (e.g., top 5).

3. **Code Organization**  
   - You may use a **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python scripts**.  
   - Keep it **readable** and **modular** (e.g., one section for loading data, one for building vectors, one for computing similarity, etc.).  
   - Briefly comment or docstring your key functions/sections.

4. **Output**  
   - When given an input description (e.g., `"I like action movies set in space"`), your system should print or return a list of recommended items (e.g., 3–5 titles).  
   - Include the similarity score or rank if you’d like.

5. **Summary & Instructions**  
   - A short `README.md` that includes:
     - **Dataset**: Where it’s from, any steps to load it.  
     - **Setup**: Python version, virtual environment instructions, and how to install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
     - **Running**: How to run your code (e.g., `python recommend.py "Some user description"` or open your notebook in Jupyter).  
     - **Results**: A brief example of your system’s output for a sample query.

## Deliverables

1. **Fork the Public Repository**  
   - **Fork** this repo into your own GitHub account.

2. **Implement Your Solution**  
   - Load and preprocess your dataset (e.g., read CSV, handle text columns).  
   - Convert text data to vectors (e.g., TF-IDF).  
   - Implement a function to compute similarity between the user’s query and each item’s description.  
   - Return the top matches.
   - Salary expectation per month (Mandatory)

3. **Short Video Demo**  
   - In a `.md` file (e.g., `demo.md`) within your fork, paste a link to a **brief screen recording** (video link).  
   - Demonstrate:
     - How you run the recommendation code.  
     - A sample query and the results.

4. **Deadline**  
   - Submit your fork by **Sunday, Feb 23th 11:59 pm PST**.

> **Note**: This should be doable within ~3 hours. Keep it **straightforward**—you do **not** need advanced neural networks or complex pipelines. A simple TF-IDF + cosine similarity approach is sufficient.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality**  
   - Does your code run without errors?  
   - When given an input query, does it successfully output relevant items?

2. **Code Quality**  
   - Clear, commented code (where it counts).  
   - Logical steps (load data → transform → recommend).

3. **Clarity**  
   - Is your `README.md` straightforward about setup, how to run, and what to expect?

4. **ML/Recommendation Understanding**  
   - Basic implementation of a content-based recommendation approach (vectorization, similarity measure).

**We look forward to seeing your solution!** Good luck!
